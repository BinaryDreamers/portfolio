## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main project.

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Name your branch descriptively based on the feature or fix you’re working on (e.g., `feature/new-ui`, `bugfix/fix-crash`).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes:**
Implement your feature or fix, ensuring that your code adheres to the project’s style and standards. Test your changes thoroughly to avoid introducing new issues.

4. **Commit Your Changes:**
Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
Detailed explanation of the change and why it is necessary.
Examples of commit types include feat for new features, fix for bug fixes, and docs for documentation updates.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature for user authentication"
```
5. **Push to Your Fork:**
Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```
6. **Submit a Pull Request:**
Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the reasoning behind them. If applicable, reference any related issues or discussions.

7. **Review and Address Feedback:**
Collaborate with the maintainers to review and address any feedback or requested changes. Be open to suggestions and iterate on your contribution as needed.

8. **Merge:**
Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch. You may be notified if additional changes are needed before merging.
